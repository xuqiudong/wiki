Believe it or not，optical illusion (错觉) can cut highway crashes. Japan is a case in point. It has reduced automobile crashes on some roads by nearly 75 percent using a simple optical illusion. Bent stripes，called chevrons (人字形), painted on the roads make drivers think that they are driving faster than they really are，and thus drivers slow down. Now the American Automobile Association Foundation for Traffic Safety in Washington D.C. is planning to repeat Japan's success. Starting next year, the foundation will paint chevrons and other patterns of stripes on selected roads around the country to test how well the patterns reduce highway crashes. Excessive speed plays a major role in as much as one fifth of all fatal traffic accidents, according to the foundation. To help reduce those accidents，the foundation will conduct its tests in areas where speed - related hazards are the greatest - curves，exit slopes，traffic circles，and bridges. Some studies suggest that straight，horizontal bars painted across roads can initially cut the average speed of drivers in half. However，traffic often returns to full speed within months as drivers become used to seeing the painted bars. Chevrons，scientists say，not only give drivers the impression that they are driving faster than they really are but also make a lane appear to be narrower. The result is a longer lasting reduction in highway speed and the number of traffic accidents.


>    信不信由你，视错觉(错觉)可以减少高速公路事故。日本就是一个很好的例子。通过简单的光学错觉，它已经将一些道路上的车祸减少了近75%。绘制在道路上的弯曲条纹，被称为“v形”(人字形)，会让司机认为他们开得比实际速度更快，因此司机会减速。现在，位于华盛顿特区的美国汽车协会交通安全基金会正计划复制日本的成功。从明年开始，该基金会将在全国选定的道路上绘制人字形和其他条纹图案，以测试这些图案在多大程度上减少了高速公路上的撞车事故。该基金会称，在所有致命交通事故中，超速是主要原因，高达五分之一。为了帮助减少这些事故，基金会将在与速度相关的危险最大的地方进行测试——弯道、出口斜坡、交通圈和桥梁。一些研究表明，画在道路上的笔直的、水平的横杠最初可以使司机的平均速度降低一半。然而，由于司机们已经习惯了这些被漆过的酒吧，交通常常在几个月内恢复到全速。科学家们说，线形标志不仅会给司机留下他们比实际开得更快的印象，还会让车道看起来更窄。其结果是高速公路速度和交通事故数量的长期下降。

Parents can have a great impact on the development of their children’s creativity in art. But first，they have to know how. They may find the following advice interesting and instructive. Encourage free drawing rather than coloring books. Coloring books stop the possibility of self-expression. A child may just enjoy colorful pictures and never learn how to express himself. As an art teacher says，“Children have a very powerful instinct to draw freely and roughly. Such practice makes them learn language easily.” In fact，a child expresses himself in rough drawing. This is the beginning of literacy and creativity. Also，parents should not teach their kids “how” to draw and they should not make their kids draw realistic pictures to entertain themselves. Experience tells us that such teaching from the parents will discourage children，making them think they can’t do it the “right” way. Competition and rewards should also be avoided in the process of artistic creation. A child’s natural instinct to create will disappear if he or she thinks about prize while drawing. Parents should be role models for their kids. They should not say things like, “I can’t draw a straight line.” Instead，they should learn to say，“I love to create”. This teaches children that the process of creation is more important than the product. If children see their parents drawing, cooking or building creatively，they wi11 do the same. Buy a notebook for your child to use every day. This can be a journal for making up stories，writing ideas and drawing pictures. Even the youngest child can use it to draw freely and roughly，expressing himself. Take your child to places that promote ideas and creativity. Art museums, science centers，libraries and children’s museums all are great places to see other people’s creativity. That will inspire children to make their own creations and inventions. Give children choices and free time. Some of the best ideas come from daydreaming and imagining. In short，parents should allow their kids to have the freedom to invent for themselves. That means not always teaching and commanding.

  > 父母对孩子艺术创造力的发展有很大的影响。但首先，他们得知道怎么做。他们可能会觉得下面的建议很有趣，很有启发性。鼓励免费绘画而不是涂色书。涂色书阻止了自我表达的可能性。一个孩子可能只是喜欢彩色的图片，从来没有学会如何表达自己。正如一位美术老师所说:“孩子们有一种非常强大的本能，能够自由而粗略地作画。这样的练习使他们学习语言更容易。”事实上，一个孩子用草图来表达自己。这是识字和创造的开始。此外，父母不应该教他们的孩子“如何”画画，他们不应该让他们的孩子画画来自娱自乐。经验告诉我们，来自父母的这种教育会让孩子气馁，让他们认为他们不能用“正确”的方式做这件事。在艺术创作过程中也要避免竞争和奖励。如果孩子在画画的时候想着奖品，他创造的本能就会消失。父母应该成为孩子的榜样。他们不应该说，“我不能画一条直线。”相反，他们应该学会说，“我喜欢创造”。这告诉孩子们，创造的过程比产品更重要。如果孩子们看到他们的父母在画画、做饭或创造性地建筑，他们也会这样做。给你的孩子买一个笔记本，每天使用。这可以是一本编故事、写想法和画画的日记。即使是最小的孩子也能用它自由而粗略地画画，表达自己。带你的孩子去那些促进思想和创造力的地方。艺术博物馆、科学中心、图书馆和儿童博物馆都是欣赏他人创造力的好地方。这将激发孩子们自己的创作和发明。给孩子选择和自由时间。一些最好的想法来自白日梦和想象。简而言之，父母应该允许他们的孩子有自己发明的自由。这意味着不总是教导和指挥。

In a family where the roles of men and women are not sharply separated and where many household tasks are shared to a greater or lesser extent, notions of male superiority are hard to maintain. The pattern of sharing in tasks and in decisions makes for equality, and this in turn leads to further sharing. In such a home, the growing boy and girl learn to accept that equality more easily than did their parents and to prepare more fully for participation in a world characterized by cooperation rather than by the “battle of sexes.” If the process goes too far and man’s role is regarded as less important that has happened in some cases----we are as badly off as before, only in reverse. It is time to reassess the role of the man in the American family. We are getting a little tired of “Momism”----but we don’t want to exchange it for a “neo-Popism.” What we need, rather, is the recognition that bringing up children involves a partnership of equals. There are signs that psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and specialists on the family are becoming more aware of the part men play and that they have decided that women should not receive all the credit----nor all the blame. We have almost given up saying that a woman’s place is in the home. We are beginning, however, to analyze man’s place in the home and to insist that he does have a place in it. Nor is that place irrelevant to the healthy development of the child. The family is a co-operative enterprise for which it is difficult to lay down rules. because each family needs to work out its own ways for solving its own problems. Excessive authoritarianism has unhappy consequences, whether it wears skirts or trousers, and the ideal of equal rights and equal responsibilities is pertinent not only to a healthy democracy, but also to a healthy family.

> 在一个男人和女人的角色没有明显分开，许多家务或多或少共同承担的家庭中，男性优越的观念是很难维持的。分担任务和决策的模式促进了平等，这反过来又导致了进一步的分担。在这样的家庭中，成长中的男孩和女孩比他们的父母更容易学会接受这种平等，并为参与以合作而不是“性别之战”为特征的世界做更充分的准备。如果这个过程走得太远，人的作用被视为不那么重要，这在某些情况下发生了----我们像以前一样糟糕，只是相反。是时候重新评估男人在美国家庭中的角色了。我们对“妈妈主义”有点厌倦了----，但我们不想把它换成“新民粹主义”。相反，我们需要的是认识到抚养孩子是一种平等的伙伴关系。有迹象表明，精神科医生、心理学家、社会工作者和家庭专家越来越意识到男性所起的作用，他们认为女性不应该得到所有的赞扬----或所有的指责。我们几乎不再说女人应该呆在家里。然而，我们开始分析人类在家庭中的地位，并坚持认为人类在家庭中确实有一席之地。这个地方与孩子的健康发展也不无关系。家庭是一个合作企业，很难为其制定规章制度。因为每个家庭都需要找到自己解决问题的方法。过度的威权主义，无论是穿裙子还是穿裤子，都会带来不愉快的后果。权利平等、责任平等的理想不仅关系到健康的民主，也关系到健康的家庭。

**A centuries-old tradition, illustrated in a modern children’s book, link the sweetness of honey with the joy of learning to read. ‘The grandpa held a jar of honey so that all the family could see. He then dipped a spoon into it and put some honey on the cover of a small book. The little girl had just turned five. ‘Stand up，little one，’he asked the girl softly. ‘I did this for your mother, your uncles，your older brother, and now you!’ Then．He handed the book to her. ‘Taste!’ She touched the honey with her finger and put it into her mouth. ‘What’s that taste?’ the grandma asked. The little girl answered,‘ Sweet!’ Then all of the family said in a single voice，‘Yes，and so is knowledge，but knowledge is from the bee that made that sweet honey, you have to go after it through the pages of a book!’ The little girl knew that the promise to read was at last hers. Soon she was going to learn to read.” This is the beginning of a profoundly moving children’s book entitled Thank You, Mr. Falker. In this book, Patricia Polacco writes of her own passion to read, inspired by the honey on the book. It wasn’t until fifth grade that she met her beloved teacher who provided the help that she needed to finally unlock the magic of the written word. Reading this book, we are in fact acquainted with some enduring traditions of child education that stress the importance of verbal capacity at a very early age. The child learning to read is admitted into a collective memory by way of books. And with the printed words that are active with meaning, the child becomes acquainted with a common past which he or she renews, to a greater or lesser degree，in every reading. Much as the author of the book Thank You, Mr．Falker puts it,” Almost as if it were magic, or as if 1ight poured into her brain, the words and sentences started to take shape on the page as they never had before…And she understood the whole thing…Then she went into the living room and found the book on a shelf, the very book that her grandpa had shown her so many years ago. She spooned honey on the cover and tasted the sweetness…Then she held the book, honey and all，close to her chest. She could feel tears roll down her cheeks, but they weren’t tears of sadness—she was happy, so very happy.”**

> 现代儿童读物中有一个古老的传统，将蜂蜜的甜味与学习阅读的乐趣联系起来。”爷爷拿着一罐蜂蜜，以便全家都能看到。然后，他用勺子蘸了蘸，在一本小书的封面上放了一些蜂蜜。这个小女孩刚满五岁。”“站起来，小家伙，”他轻轻地问女孩我这样做是为了你的母亲，你的叔叔，你的哥哥，还有现在的你！”然后，他把书递给了她。”味道！”她用手指触摸蜂蜜，然后把它放进嘴里。”那是什么味道？”奶奶问。小女孩回答说：“太好了！”然后全家人都用单一的声音说：“是的，知识也是，但知识来自酿造甜蜜的蜜蜂，你必须通过书页去寻找它！”小女孩知道读书的承诺最终是她的。很快她就要学会读书了。”这是一本感人至深的儿童读物《谢谢你，福克先生》的开始。在这本书中，帕特里夏·波尔卡科（Patricia Polacco）写下了她自己的阅读激情，这是受到书中蜂蜜的启发。直到五年级，她才遇到了她敬爱的老师，老师为她提供了帮助，她终于解开了书写文字的魔力。读了这本书，我们实际上了解了一些儿童教育的持久传统，这些传统强调幼儿语言能力的重要性。学习阅读的孩子通过书本进入集体记忆。有了印刷出来的具有积极意义的单词，孩子们在每次阅读中都会或多或少地更新一个共同的过去。正如《谢谢你》（Thank You）一书的作者福克先生所说的那样，“几乎就像魔法一样，或者就像光线注入她的大脑一样，单词和句子开始在页面上形成以前从未有过的形状……她理解了整件事……然后她走进客厅，在一个书架上找到了这本书，就是她爷爷多年前给她看的那本书。她用勺子舀了一勺封面上的蜂蜜，尝了尝甜味……然后，她把那本书，蜂蜜和所有的东西，放在胸前。她能感觉到眼泪顺着脸颊流下来，但那不是悲伤的眼泪，她很高兴，非常高兴。”

**It is often said that politeness costs nothing. In fact, it seems that a little more politeness could save businesses￡5 billion every year. Frequently hearing the phrase” thank you” or” well done” means the same to staff as modest pay rise. Praise and encouragement also makes employees more likely to work hard and stay in their jobs. In this way the business companies can save the cost of finding new employees. A third of 1,000 workers surveyed by a consulting firm said they did not get thanked at all when they did well一and a further third said they were not thanked enough. In both cases，staff said they felt undervalued，meaning they were less likely to exert themselves and were more likely to look for employment elsewhere. The result of the survey shows that there would be around￡5.2 billion loss in productivity if the employees felt less appreciated. According to the firm，praising staff has the same positive effect as a 1 per cent pay rise—and works out much cheaper for bosses. Three out of four employees said that regular acknowledgement by their bosses was important to them, but only a quarter said they were actually given as much praise as they felt they needed. The survey found that those in blue-collar and manual jobs were less likely to be given any recognition for doing well. But it seems that they most need such praise. In regional terms，Scottish staff felt most undervalued. Four out of ten workers said they were never thanked and eight out of ten said they would like more praise. However, workers in the North-East are less impressed by being praised by the boss，as only 69 per cent said they felt the need to be told ”well done”regularly. Older employees and women need the most reassurance，according to psychologist Averil Leimon. She said that words of praise did more than creating a pleasant place to work—they could even promote profits.**

> 人们常说，礼貌是免费的。事实上，礼貌一点似乎可以挽救企业￡每年50亿美元。经常听到“谢谢”或“干得好”这句话，对员工来说意味着适度的加薪。表扬和鼓励也会使员工更努力工作，并继续工作。这样，企业可以节省寻找新员工的成本。一家咨询公司调查的1000名员工中，有三分之一的人表示，他们表现出色时根本没有得到感谢一还有三分之一的人表示，他们没有得到足够的感谢。在这两起案件中，员工们都表示，他们觉得自己被低估了，这意味着他们不太可能发挥自己的能力，更有可能在其他地方寻找工作。调查结果显示￡如果员工感觉不那么受重视，则会导致52亿生产力损失。根据该公司的说法，表扬员工与1%的加薪具有同样的积极作用，而且对老板来说要便宜得多。四分之三的员工表示，老板的定期表扬对他们来说很重要，但只有四分之一的员工表示他们实际上得到了他们认为需要的赞扬。调查发现，那些从事蓝领和体力工作的人不太可能因为表现出色而得到任何认可。但似乎他们最需要这样的赞扬。就地区而言，苏格兰员工感到最受低估。十分之四的员工表示他们从未得到过感谢，十分之八的员工表示希望得到更多表扬。然而，东北部的员工对老板的表扬不太满意，因为只有69%的人说他们觉得有必要定期被告知“干得好”。心理学家艾薇尔·莱蒙表示，年长的员工和女性最需要安慰。她说，表扬不仅仅是创造一个愉快的工作场所，甚至可以促进利润。

**Many people think New York is a noisy city. In fact, scientists who study noise say that the average noise level in New York is 72.5 decibels. This is a little louder than normal conversation, which is 65 decibels. The noise level is the result of so many people and cars in the same area. Now even the insides of taxis are noisy. When you get into a taxi, you hear the voice of a well-known singer, sports reporter, or Broadway actress giving instructions. That’s right. The voice of a famous person tells you what to do. One popular singer gives this message:” Cats have nine lives, but you have only one, to fasten your seat beat!” Other voices say things such as “Don’t forget to collect all your belongings.”(People often leave hats, umbrella, and bags in taxis.) There is a good reason for the messages. There are more than 12,000 cabs in New York, and every year taxis get into more than 15,000 accidents. In an accident, people who don’t wear seat belts hit the partition, the glass wall separating the driver and passengers in the taxi. They can hurt their foreheads or break their noses or chins. Every year, about 11,000 people are injured in this way. Many people are annoyed by the voices. Cabdrivers in particular dislike the messages. ”I play the messages 12 hours a day. I hear the same voices 60 times a day. It makes me crazy,” says Atnis, a 45-year-old cabdriver.“But if I don’t play the messages, I get fined 100 dollars.” A lot of passengers complained, too. “It’s too much noise,” says a passenger, “I asked the driver to turn off the message, but he said he can’t.” Other people think the voices are a great idea. One taxi driver says,” People like to hear the famous voices, and they put on their seat belts more often.” And passengers from out of town really like the idea. “Most of the time, taxi drivers are in a bad mood, ”says Melanie Benton, who visits New York often on business, “It's nice to hear a cheerful voice when you get into a cab.”**

> 许多人认为纽约是一个嘈杂的城市。事实上，研究噪音的科学家说，纽约的平均噪音水平为72.5分贝。这比65分贝的正常对话声音大一点。噪音水平是同一地区如此多的人和汽车造成的。现在，甚至出租车内部也很吵。当你坐上出租车时，你会听到一位著名歌手、体育记者或百老汇女演员的声音在发出指令。没错。名人的声音告诉你该怎么做。一位流行歌手给出了这样的信息：“猫有九条命，但你只有一条命，要扣紧你的座位！”其他人会说“别忘了把你所有的东西都收起来。”（人们经常把帽子、雨伞和袋子留在出租车里。）。纽约有12000多辆出租车，每年出租车都会发生15000多起事故。在一次事故中，不系安全带的人撞上了隔墙，隔墙是将出租车司机和乘客隔开的玻璃墙。他们可能会伤到额头，或者打断鼻子或下巴。每年约有11000人以这种方式受伤。许多人对这些声音感到恼火。出租车司机尤其不喜欢这些信息。”我每天12小时播放短信。我每天听到60次同样的声音。45岁的出租车司机阿特尼斯（Atnis）说。“但如果我不播放短信，我会被罚款100美元。”许多乘客也抱怨道。“噪音太大了，”一位乘客说，“我让司机关掉留言，但他说不行。”其他人认为声音是个好主意。一位出租车司机说：“人们喜欢听那些著名的声音，他们更经常地系上安全带。”来自外地的乘客非常喜欢这个主意。“大多数时候，出租车司机心情不好，”梅兰妮·本顿（Melanie Benton）说，她经常出差到纽约，“当你坐上出租车时，听到一个愉快的声音很好。”

> **在一些国家，妇女从事同样工作的报酬低于男子。在这种情况发生的地方，雇主的论点是，男人通常有妻子和孩子需要抚养，而女人通常没有。他们说，大多数女工要么未婚，没有人赡养，要么有丈夫也工作，带着钱回家，所以他们的工资与妻子不工作，因为妻子在家有几个孩子要照顾的男人一样不公平。这当然是千真万确的；但你确实会发现，有些男性工人未婚，无人抚养，还有一些女性工人是寡妇，有孩子需要抚养。其他女工虽然没有孩子，但可能有年老或生病的父母以及还不能工作的弟弟妹妹。事实上，根据工人的家庭需要支付工资的问题不能简单地通过给男人更多，给女人更少来解决。答案是两者支付相同，并通过税收和津贴的方式将其交给州司法**

 Music which is original is individual and personal. That is to say, it can be identified as belonging to a particular composer. It has particular qualities, or a style, which are not copied from another. If you can recognize the style of a composer, you will probably be able to tell that a certain composition belongs to him or her even though you have never heard it before. A basket-maker has the skill of weaving and interweaving his materials to create colorful patterns, and an expert carpenter（木匠）has the skill of joining together different shapes and sizes of wood to make a beautiful piece of furniture. These skills may be referred to as "workmanship"（技艺）. Similarly, in music a composer organizes his melodies（旋律）and rhythms and combines sounds to create harmony. A composer may be capable of thinking up very good, original tunes, yet if tunes are poorly organized, that is, if the workmanship is poor, the final result will not be to standard. Good music expresses feelings in a way that is suitable to those feelings. There may joy, sorrow, fear, love, anger, or whatever. Bad music, on the other hand, may confuse unrelated feelings, it may not express any important feeling at all, or it may exaggerate some feelings and make them vulgar, that is, cheap and ugly. Good music will stand the test of time. It will not go out of fashion but will continue to be enjoyed and respected long after it is first introduced. It will gain a kind of permanent status while bad music will disappear and be forgotten quickly. In pop music, where the general rule seems to be “the newer the better”, the test of time is the hardest test of all to pass. 

> 原创音乐是个人和个人的。也就是说，它可以被识别为属于某个特定的作曲家。它具有独特的品质或风格，而不是模仿别人。如果你能认出作曲家的风格，你就可能知道某篇作品属于他或她，即使你以前从未听说过。篮筐制造者有编织和交织材料的技能，可以创造出彩色图案，而木匠则是专家(木匠）具有将不同形状和尺寸的木材连接在一起以制作漂亮家具的技能。这些技能可以称为“工艺”(技艺）. 同样，在音乐中，作曲家组织他的旋律(旋律）和节奏，并结合声音创造和谐。作曲家可能会想出非常好的原创曲调，但如果曲调组织得不好，也就是说，如果工艺不好，最终的结果将不符合标准。好的音乐以适合这些感觉的方式表达情感。可能有欢乐、悲伤、恐惧、爱、愤怒或其他什么。另一方面，糟糕的音乐可能会混淆无关的情感，它可能根本无法表达任何重要的情感，或者它可能会夸大某些情感，使其变得粗俗，即廉价和丑陋。好音乐经得起时间的考验。它不会过时，但会在首次推出后很长一段时间内继续受到人们的喜爱和尊重。它将获得一种永久的地位，而坏音乐将很快消失并被遗忘。在流行音乐

**For Americans, time is a “resource” that, like water or coal, can be used well or poorly. “Time is money,” they say. “You only get so much time in this life; you’d best use it wisely.” The future will not be better than the past or the present unless people use their time fro constructive, future-oriented activities. Thus, Americans admire a “well-organized” person, one who has a written list of things to do and a schedule for doing them. The ideal person is punctual and treasures other people’s time. The American attitude towards time is not necessarily shared by others, especially non-Europeans. They are more likely to consider time as something that is simply there around them, not something they can “use”. One of the more difficult things many foreign businessmen and students must adjust to in the States is the notion that time must be saved whenever possible and used wisely every day. In their efforts to use their time. Wisely, Americans are sometimes seen by foreign visitors as automatons, unhuman creatures who are so tied to their clocks and their schedules that they cannot participate in or enjoy the human interactions that are the truly important things in life. “They are like little machines running around,” one foreign visitor said. The emphasis Americans place on efficiency is closely related to their concepts of the future, change and time. To do something efficiently is to do it in the way that is quickest and requires the smallest investment of resources. American businesses sometimes hire “efficiency experts” to review their operations and suggest ways in which they could accomplish more than they are currently accomplishing with the resources they are investing. Popular periodicals carry suggestions for more efficient ways to clean house, raise children, tend the yard, and so on. In this context the “fast-food industry” can be seen as a clear example of an American cultural product. McDonald’s, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut, and other fast-food establishments prosper in a country where many people want to minimize the amount of time they spend preparing and eating meals. The millions of Americans who take their meals at fast-food restaurants cannot have much interest in lingering over their food while conversing with friends, as millions of Europeans do. As McDonald’s restaurants have spread around the world, they have been viewed as symbols of American society and culture, bringing not just hamburgers but an emphasis on speed, efficiency, and shiny cleanliness.The typical American food, some observers argue, is fast food.**

> 对美国人来说，时间是一种“资源”，就像水或煤一样，可以用得好也可以用得差。他们说：“时间就是金钱。”。“你此生只有这么多时间；你最好明智地利用它。”除非人们把时间用于建设性的、面向未来的活动，否则未来不会比过去或现在更好。因此，美国人钦佩一个“井然有序”的人，一个有书面的事情清单和时间表的人。理想的人是守时的，珍惜别人的时间。美国人对时间的态度不一定与其他人，尤其是非欧洲人一样。他们更可能认为时间只是存在于他们周围的东西，而不是他们可以“使用”的东西。在美国，许多外国商人和学生必须适应的更困难的事情之一是，必须尽可能节省时间，每天都要明智地利用时间。在努力利用自己的时间。明智的是，美国人有时被外国游客视为机器人，是不人道的生物，他们被自己的时钟和时间表所束缚，无法参与或享受生活中真正重要的人与人之间的互动。一位外国游客说：“它们就像是四处奔波的小机器。”。美国人对效率的重视与他们对未来、变化和时间的概念密切相关。高效地做某事就是以最快的方式做，并且需要最少的资源投资。美国企业有时会聘请“效率专家”来审查他们的运营情况，并提出一些方法，使他们能够用投资的资源取得比目前更多的成就。流行的期刊对如何更有效地打扫房间、抚养孩子、照料院子等提出了建议。在这种情况下，“快餐业”可以被视为美国文化产品的一个明显例子。麦当劳、肯德基炸鸡、必胜客和其他快餐店在一个许多人都希望尽量减少做饭和用餐时间的国家蓬勃发展。数百万在快餐店用餐的美国人不会像数百万欧洲人那样，一边和朋友聊天，一边留恋美食。随着麦当劳餐厅遍布世界各地，它们被视为美国社会和文化的象征，不仅带来了汉堡，还强调了速度、效率和闪亮的清洁度。一些观察家认为，典型的美国食物是快餐

**Online learning is also called distance education, which helps students who take classes by computer over the Internet to learn certain courses and earn a degree. And it has become more and more popular with both young people and educational institutions. The School of Continuing and Professional Studies of New York University in Manhattan began online classes in 1992. Its Virtual School has taught more than 10, 000 students from across the United States and other countries. Last year, the school launched NYU Online. It offers NYU’s first online programs for a bachelor’s degree. Programs are offered in three areas: leadership and management, information systems management and social sciences. The classes are highly interactive, where students communicate with each other and their teachers. Some classes require students to log in at the same time so they can attend live lectures by a professor. Students can also ask questions and work together on team projects. The cost to attend NYU Online depends on how many classes a student is to take. It costs as much as fifteen thousand dollars a year. NYU offers no financial aid for international students in this program. If you are interested in the program, you can get more details at the website: www.nyu.edu. Many other schools, too, offer online education. Students should be especially careful of programs that offer a degree in return for little or no work. These are known as diploma mills, and are illegal in the United States. Educational advisers also say that before you enter any program, make sure the work will be recognized in your country. You should also make sure the schools you are considering are officially approved.**

> 在线学习也称为远程教育，它帮助通过互联网上的计算机上课的学生学习某些课程并获得学位。它已经越来越受到年轻人和教育机构的欢迎。位于曼哈顿的纽约大学继续与专业研究学院于1992年开始开设在线课程。该学院的虚拟学校已经教了来自美国和其他国家的10000多名学生。去年，该校推出了纽约大学在线课程。它为纽约大学提供了第一批学士学位在线课程。课程分为三个领域：领导与管理、信息系统管理和社会科学。课堂互动性很强，学生之间和老师之间相互交流。有些课程要求学生同时登录，以便他们可以参加教授的现场讲座。学生们还可以提出问题，共同完成团队项目。参加纽约大学在线课程的费用取决于学生要上多少课。它一年的费用高达一万五千美元。纽约大学不为该项目的国际学生提供经济援助。如果您对该计划感兴趣，可以访问网站www.nyu.edu了解更多详细信息。许多其他学校也提供在线教育。学生应该特别注意那些提供学位以换取很少或没有工作的课程。这些工厂被称为文凭工厂，在美国是非法的。教育顾问也说，在你参加任何项目之前，确保你的工作在你的国家得到认可。你还应该确保你正在考虑的学校得到正式批准

**Among the company was a lawyer, a young man of about twenty-five. On being asked his opinion, he said, “Capital punishment and life imprisonment are equally immoral. If I were to make a choice between them, I would rather choose the latter. Anyway, it’s better to live than not to live at all. ” A lively discussion followed. A banker, who was then younger and more nervous than the lawyer, suddenly lost his temper and cried out, “It’s a lie. I bet you two millions. You wouldn’t stick in a cell even for five years. ” “If you mean it, ” replied the young lawyer, “I bet I’ll stay there longer; make it fifteen instead of five. ” “Fifteen! Done ! ” cried the banker. “Gentleman, I bet you two millions. ” “Agreed. Two millions for my freedom, ” said the lawyer. So this wild, ridiculous bet came to pass. The banker could not hide his excitement. During supper he said to the lawyer jokingly, “Come to your senses, young man, before it’s too late. Two millions are nothing to me, but you stand to lose three or four of the best years of your life. I say three or four because you’ll never stick it out any longer. Don’t forget that voluntary imprisonment is much harder to put up with than an enforced one. The idea that you have the right to free yourself any moment will poison your life in the cell. I pity you. ” And now the banker, pacing from corner to corner, recalled all this and asked himself, “Why did I make this bet? What’s the good? The lawyer lost fifteen years of his life and I threw away two millions. Will it convince people that capital punishment is worse or better than imprisonment for life? No, no! Rubbish! On my part, it was the ca‘price of a well-fed millionaire; on the lawyer’s part, it’s the pure greed of gold. ”**

> 公司里有一位律师，一位大约二十五岁的年轻人。当被问及他的观点时，他说：“死刑和无期徒刑同样不道德。如果我要在两者之间做出选择，我宁愿选择后者。无论如何，活着总比不活着好。”随后进行了热烈的讨论。一位银行家，当时比律师年轻，更紧张，突然发了脾气，喊道：“这是一个谎言。我赌你两百万。你甚至五年都不会待在牢房里。”“如果你是认真的，”年轻的律师回答说，“我打赌我会在那里呆得更长，把它改为十五，而不是五。”“十五！完成！”银行家喊道。“先生，我跟你赌两百万。”“同意。两百万是为了我的自由，”律师说。于是，这个疯狂而荒谬的赌注应运而生。银行家无法掩饰自己的兴奋。晚饭时，他开玩笑地对律师说：， “年轻人，醒悟吧，趁现在还为时已晚。两百万对我来说算不了什么，但你会失去三四年你生命中最美好的时光。我说三四年是因为你再也坚持不下去了。别忘了，自愿监禁比强迫监禁更难忍受。你有权随时释放自己的想法会毒害你的细胞中的生命。我很同情你。”现在银行家从一个角落走到另一个角落，回忆起这一切，问自己：，“我为什么下这个赌注？有什么好处？律师失去了15年的生命，我丢掉了200万。这会让人们相信死刑比终身监禁更糟糕还是更好吗？不，不！垃圾！就我而言，这是一个吃得饱足的百万富翁的钱；就律师而言，这纯粹是对黄金的贪婪。”

**Among my experiences as a college president is the all-too-frequent phone call in the night that begins: “One of your students is in the hospital with alcohol poisoning (酒精中毒).” The whole country got a similar wake-up call in June when it was reported that alcohol abuse on college campuses is on the rise, especially for women, and that college students drink far more than nonstudents. One statistic showed that college students spend more money on alcohol while in college than on books. Alcohol abuse, although tragic, is but one symptom of a larger campus crisis. Students use alcohol as an escape. It’s used as an excuse for bad behavior: campus violence, eating disorders, property damage and cheating. It is happening because the generation now entering college has experienced few real connections with adults in its lifetime. I call this the “Culture of Neglect,” and we – parents, teachers, professors and administrators—are the primary architects. It begins at home, where social and economic factors—such as rising prices and declining wages requiring longer work hours—result in less family time. Young people have been allowed to or must take part-time jobs rather than spending time in school, on homework or with their families. More children are being brought up with television as their only supervisor (监督者), and there is little expectation that they learn personal responsibility. Colleges and universities must also accept some responsibility for the culture of neglect, for we have given in to the lower standards of the larger culture. Teachers and administrators have lowered their expectation. Academic demands placed on college students are less than they need or are capable of handling. Yet, despite low expectations and standards, fewer than half of all students who enter college ever graduate, and those who do increasingly are seen by employers as having learned too little. A nation of individuals who cannot read or write well, who cannot think critically, and who are unable to act responsibly, will be ill equipped to compete. A culture of neglect demands little. ⑤A culture of responsibility demands more from all of us but holds the promise of far greater rewards.**

> 在我担任大学校长的经历中，有一件事发生在晚上：“你的一个学生因酒精中毒住院了(酒精中毒).” 6月份，全国各地都接到了类似的警钟，据报道，大学校园里的酗酒现象呈上升趋势，尤其是对女性而言，而且大学生比非大学生喝得多。一项统计数据显示，大学生在大学期间在酒精上的花费比在书本上的花费要多。酗酒虽然悲惨，但只是校园危机的一个症状。学生们用酒精作为逃避。它被用作不良行为的借口：校园暴力、饮食失调、财产损失和作弊。之所以发生这种情况，是因为现在进入大学的这一代人在其一生中很少与成年人有真正的联系。我称之为“忽视文化”，而我们——父母、教师、教授和管理者——是主要的建筑师。它始于家庭，在那里，社会和经济因素，如价格上涨和工资下降，需要更长的工作时间，导致家庭时间减少。年轻人被允许或必须从事兼职工作，而不是花时间在学校、家庭作业或与家人在一起。越来越多的孩子被电视作为他们唯一的监护人抚养长大(监督者), 很少有人期望他们学会承担个人责任。学院和大学也必须为忽视文化承担一些责任，因为我们已经屈服于大文化的较低标准。教师和管理人员降低了他们的期望。对大学生的学术要求低于他们需要或能够应付的程度。然而，尽管期望值和标准较低，但在所有进入大学的学生中，只有不到一半的学生毕业，而且越来越多的学生毕业后，雇主认为他们学到的东西太少。如果一个国家的人读写不好，思维不批判性强，行为不负责任，那么他们就没有能力参与竞争。忽视的文化要求很少。⑤责任文化对我们所有人都有更高的要求，但承诺会得到更大的回报。

**Why does cream go bad faster than butter? Some researchers think they have the answer，and it comes down to the structure of the food，not its chemical composition - a finding that could help rid some processed foods of chemical preservatives. Cream and butter contain pretty much the same substances，so why cream should sour much faster has been a mystery. Both are emulsions - tiny globules(小球)of one liquid evenly distributed throughout another. The difference lies in what's in the globules and what's in the surrounding liquid，says Brocklehurst，who led the investigation. In cream，fatty globules drift about in a sea of water. In butter，globules of a watery solution are locked away in a sea of fat. The bacteria which make the food go bad prefer to live in the watery regions of the mixture. "This means that in cream，the bacteria are free to grow throughout the mixture，"he says. When the situation is reversed，the bacteria are locked away in compartments (密封仓) buried deep in the sea of fat. Trapped in this way，individual colonies cannot spread and rapidly run out of nutrients(养料). They also slowly poison themselves with their waste products. "In butter，you get a self - limiting system which stops the bacteria growing，"says Brocklehurst. The researchers are already working with food companies keen to see if their products can be made resistant to bacterial attack through alterations to the food's structure. Brocklehurst believes it will be possible to make the emulsions used in salad cream，for instance，more like that in butter. The key will be to do this while keeping the salad cream liquid and not turning it into a solid lump.**

> 为什么奶油比黄油变质更快？一些研究人员认为他们已经找到了答案，这归结于食物的结构，而不是其化学成分——这一发现可能有助于去除一些加工食品中的化学防腐剂。奶油和黄油含有几乎相同的物质，所以为什么奶油酸得更快一直是个谜。两者都是乳状液-微小的小球(小球)一种液体均匀分布在另一种液体中。这项调查的负责人布罗克赫斯特说，区别在于球状体中的物质和周围液体中的物质。在奶油中，脂肪球在海水中四处漂流。在黄油中，水溶液的小球被锁在脂肪的海洋中。使食物变质的细菌更喜欢生活在混合物的含水区域。“这意味着在奶油中，细菌可以在混合物中自由生长，”他说。当情况逆转时，细菌被锁在隔间里(密封仓) 深埋在脂肪的海洋里。这样一来，单个菌落就无法扩散，营养也会迅速耗尽(养料). 他们也慢慢地用他们的废品毒害自己。Brocklehurst说：“在黄油中，你有一个自我限制系统，可以阻止细菌生长。”。研究人员已经在与食品公司合作，希望通过改变食品结构，使其产品能够抵抗细菌攻击。Brocklehurst相信有可能使沙拉奶油中使用的乳液更像黄油中的乳液。关键是要做到这一点，同时保持沙拉奶油的液体，而不是变成一个固体块。
